# Feature Specification: Webhook Proxy Service Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-simple`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a simple webhook proxy service that can receive generic webhook events from any external system, log and store selected fields into a database, and forward a formatted notification to a target endpoint such as a Discord webhook, with minimal configuration, no authentication or crypto, and a focus on easy extensibility for different event sources and destinations."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An operations engineer wants to capture webhook notifications from multiple SaaS tools, store key fields for auditing, and forward a concise alert to a team chat webhook without writing custom glue code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the service is configured with a source identifier and mapping rules, **When** an external system posts a webhook payload to the proxy endpoint, **Then** the service stores the mapped fields in the database and sends a formatted message to the configured destination.
2. **Given** a new destination webhook URL is provided through configuration, **When** the service processes the next incoming event, **Then** the outbound notification uses the updated destination without requiring a restart.

### Edge Cases
- If mapping references missing fields, treat values as empty (null/"N/A"), store the event, and send the notification using defaults.
- If the destination returns an error or exceeds a 5s timeout, record a failed delivery with details; do not retry; continue processing other events.
- If the database is unavailable when an event arrives, respond 503 to the sender and do not buffer; rely on upstream retry behavior.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What is the inbound webhook rate limit policy? ‚Üí A: No rate limiting; rely on upstream systems

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What data should persist for each webhook event? ‚Üí A: Store both the full raw payload and the extracted fields with metadata
- Q: What retention window should we enforce for stored webhook events? ‚Üí A: Retain indefinitely until manual purge
- Q: How should we handle potentially sensitive data (PII/PHI) in inbound webhook payloads when storing the ‚Äúraw payload‚Äù? ‚Üí A: Assume non-sensitive; store full raw payload as-is
- Q: How should the service handle duplicate webhook deliveries (retries of the same event)? ‚Üí A: No dedup; every delivery stored as a new event (per user directive: choose simplest)
- Q: Behavior when mapping references a missing field? ‚Üí A: Store event; leave missing values empty; send notification with defaults (per user directive)
- Q: What is the retry policy and timeout for outbound destination calls? ‚Üí A: No retries; 5s timeout; record failure (per user directive)
- Q: What is the behavior if the database is unavailable on write? ‚Üí A: Respond 503; no buffering; rely on upstream retry (per user directive)
- Q: How are configuration changes applied without restart? ‚Üí A: Auto-detect config changes within 60 seconds; no restart (per user directive)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The service MUST operate without an internal inbound rate limit, assuming upstream systems throttle appropriately; documentation must highlight reliance on upstream controls.
- **FR-002**: The service MUST expose a public endpoint that accepts webhook requests using standard HTTP verbs (at minimum POST).
- **FR-003**: The service MUST allow configuring multiple source identifiers, each with a definition of which payload fields to store and forward.
- **FR-004**: The service MUST persist the full raw payload alongside selected payload fields, timestamp, and source identifier for every received event.
- **FR-005**: The service MUST format and deliver a notification to at least one outbound webhook destination (e.g., Discord-style webhook URL) for every successfully stored event.
- **FR-006**: The service MUST continue processing new events even if a particular destination call fails, and MUST record the failure for later review.
- **FR-007**: The service MUST provide a minimal configuration interface (file or environment-based) to define sources, field mappings, and destination endpoints.
- **FR-008**: The platform MUST supply Go-based PocketBase migrations that run automatically on startup and are invocable via CLI for schema changes.
- **FR-009**: The platform MUST retain stored webhook events indefinitely until an operator-triggered purge (runbook-driven) is executed.
- **FR-010**: The service MUST assume inbound payloads are non-sensitive and store the full raw payload unredacted; documentation MUST state that PII/PHI/secrets must not be sent to the service.
- **FR-011**: The service MUST NOT perform deduplication; each inbound delivery is treated as a new `WebhookEvent` regardless of payload or headers.
- **FR-012**: Outbound destination calls MUST use a 5s timeout and MUST NOT auto-retry; failures MUST be recorded with error details.
- **FR-013**: If persistence fails (e.g., database unavailable), the service MUST return HTTP 503 and MUST NOT buffer or queue events; upstream systems are expected to retry.
- **FR-014**: When mapping rules reference missing fields, the service MUST store the event and proceed, substituting empty or default placeholders in notifications.
- **FR-015**: Configuration changes MUST take effect without process restart within 60 seconds of update.
- **FR-016**: The service MUST emit basic observability: structured logs per event and counters for `events_received_total`, `events_stored_total`, `notifications_sent_total`, and `notifications_failed_total`.
- **FR-017**: The service MUST enforce an inbound payload size limit of 1 MiB and reject larger requests with 413.
- **FR-018**: The service MUST NOT require inbound authentication; security hardening and auth are out of scope for this feature and deferred to a future iteration.
- **FR-019**: This feature targets low volume (single instance, best-effort) usage; horizontal scaling, HA, and rate controls are out of scope.
- **FR-020**: Provide a version-controlled admin command (e.g., `purge-events`) that runs with the same configuration/environment as the service, accompanied by a runbook covering execution, monitoring, and rollback.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **WebhookEvent**: Represents a single inbound webhook occurrence; includes unique ID (ULID), source identifier, received timestamp, stored raw payload body, extracted fields, and delivery status. No deduplication is applied; each delivery becomes a distinct record.
- **DestinationMapping**: Captures configuration linking a source identifier to one or more outbound destinations, field selection rules, and message formatting template.
- **DeliveryLog**: Tracks each attempt to forward a stored event to a destination, including timestamp, destination identifier, success/failure outcome, and error message if applicable; no automatic retries are performed.
