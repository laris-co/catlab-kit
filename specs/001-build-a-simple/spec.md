# Feature Specification: Webhook Proxy Service Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-simple`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a simple webhook proxy service that can receive generic webhook events from any external system, log and store selected fields into a database, and forward a formatted notification to a target endpoint such as a Discord webhook, with minimal configuration, no authentication or crypto, and a focus on easy extensibility for different event sources and destinations."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An operations engineer wants to capture webhook notifications from multiple SaaS tools, store key fields for auditing, and forward a concise alert to a team chat webhook without writing custom glue code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the service is configured with a source identifier and mapping rules, **When** an external system posts a webhook payload to the proxy endpoint, **Then** the service stores the mapped fields in the database and sends a formatted message to the configured destination.
2. **Given** a new destination webhook URL is provided through configuration, **When** the service processes the next incoming event, **Then** the outbound notification uses the updated destination without requiring a restart.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the incoming payload is missing fields referenced by the mapping rules?
- How does the system handle a downstream destination returning an error or timing out?
- What occurs if the database is temporarily unavailable when an event arrives?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The service MUST expose a public endpoint that accepts webhook requests using standard HTTP verbs (at minimum POST).
- **FR-002**: The service MUST allow configuring multiple source identifiers, each with a definition of which payload fields to store and forward.
- **FR-003**: The service MUST persist selected payload fields, timestamp, and source identifier for every received event.
- **FR-004**: The service MUST format and deliver a notification to at least one outbound webhook destination (e.g., Discord-style webhook URL) for every successfully stored event.
- **FR-005**: The service MUST continue processing new events even if a particular destination call fails, and MUST record the failure for later review.
- **FR-006**: The service MUST provide a minimal configuration interface (file or environment-based) to define sources, field mappings, and destination endpoints.
- **FR-007**: The service MUST support adding new event field mappings or destinations without code changes beyond configuration updates.
- **FR-008**: The service MUST log all received events with correlation identifiers to trace inbound to outbound activity.
- **FR-009**: The service MUST support replaying stored events to destinations on demand. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Does the initial release need a replay capability or is archival storage sufficient?]
- **FR-010**: The service MUST define retention and purging rules for stored events. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How long should events remain in the database?]
- **FR-011**: The service MUST specify behavior for oversized payloads or rate limits. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What payload size and throughput should be assumed?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **WebhookEvent**: Represents a single inbound webhook occurrence; includes source identifier, received timestamp, raw payload reference, extracted fields, delivery status.
- **DestinationMapping**: Captures configuration linking a source identifier to one or more outbound destinations, field selection rules, and message formatting template.
- **DeliveryLog**: Tracks each attempt to forward a stored event to a destination, including timestamp, destination identifier, success/failure outcome, and error message if applicable.
