# Feature Specification: Claude Code Custom Command Migration

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-claude-code`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create claude code custom command that migrate from my short code in @CLAUDE.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí User wants to migrate short codes from CLAUDE.md to Claude Code custom commands
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users, Claude Code system
   ‚Üí Actions: Migrate, create custom commands
   ‚Üí Data: Short codes from CLAUDE.md (ccc, nnn, rrr, gogogo, lll)
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must integrate with existing Claude Code command structure
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific short codes from CLAUDE.md should be migrated?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the migration preserve existing behavior exactly?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: User types migrated short code and gets expected behavior
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on user-facing capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Short codes, Commands, Migration mapping
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding specific short codes to migrate"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: Which specific short codes should be migrated from CLAUDE.md to Claude Code custom commands? ‚Üí A: All codes except lll (ccc, nnn, rrr, gogogo)
- Q: How should workflow dependencies between commands be managed? ‚Üí A: Smart suggestions based on current project state
- Q: What should happen when a migrated short code conflicts with existing Claude Code commands? ‚Üí A: Prefix migrated codes (e.g., cc-ccc, cc-nnn)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user who is familiar with the short codes defined in CLAUDE.md (such as `ccc`, `nnn`, `rrr`, `gogogo`, `lll`) wants to continue using these abbreviated commands within Claude Code's custom command system instead of having to remember and type longer command sequences.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has access to Claude Code, **When** they type a migrated short code (e.g., `ccc`), **Then** the system executes the corresponding workflow defined in CLAUDE.md
2. **Given** a user types `nnn`, **When** the command executes, **Then** the system performs the planning workflow without modifying or implementing files
3. **Given** a user types `rrr`, **When** the command executes, **Then** the system creates a detailed session retrospective
4. **Given** a user types `gogogo`, **When** the command executes, **Then** the system executes the most recent implementation plan step-by-step
5. **Given** a user types `lll`, **When** the command executes, **Then** the system lists current project status using parallel git and gh commands

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a short code conflicts with existing Claude Code commands?
- How does the system handle deprecated short codes that are no longer relevant?
- What feedback does the user get if a migrated command fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide custom commands for each relevant short code from CLAUDE.md
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve the original functionality and behavior of each migrated short code
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to invoke migrated commands using prefixed abbreviated syntax (cc-ccc, cc-nnn, cc-rrr, cc-gogogo)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear documentation for each migrated command explaining its purpose and usage
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle command execution in the appropriate mode (planning vs implementation)
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with existing Claude Code command infrastructure
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide error messages when commands cannot be executed due to missing context or prerequisites
- **FR-010**: System MUST use "cc-" prefix for migrated commands to prevent conflicts with existing Claude Code commands (cc-ccc, cc-nnn, cc-rrr, cc-gogogo)

*Requirements with uncertainties:*
- **FR-008**: System MUST migrate exactly four short codes: ccc, nnn, rrr, and gogogo
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide intelligent workflow suggestions based on current project state (git status, recent issues, existing context)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Short Code**: Abbreviated command identifier with associated behavior (e.g., "ccc", "nnn", "rrr")
- **Command Definition**: Full specification of what each short code does, including parameters and expected outcomes
- **Migration Mapping**: Relationship between original CLAUDE.md workflow patterns and new Claude Code custom commands
- **Execution Context**: Current state needed for commands to execute properly (e.g., git status, recent issues)
