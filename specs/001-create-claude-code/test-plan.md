# Manual Test Plan: Claude Code Short Commands

**Feature**: 001-create-claude-code
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Test Type**: Manual Integration Testing

## Overview

This test plan validates the 4 migrated Claude Code custom commands (cc-ccc, cc-nnn, cc-rrr, cc-gogogo) work correctly with Claude Code CLI and maintain original functionality while adding smart workflow suggestions.

## Test Prerequisites

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Claude Code CLI installed and functional
- [ ] Git repository with some history
- [ ] GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated and functional
- [ ] Test repository with sample changes (uncommitted files)
- [ ] Access to `.claude/commands/` directory

### Test Data Requirements
- [ ] Sample uncommitted git changes for cc-ccc testing
- [ ] Existing GitHub issues for context detection
- [ ] Sample retrospective scenarios with git history
- [ ] Implementation plan issues for cc-gogogo testing

## Test Scenarios

### T003.1: Command Discovery & Invocation
**Objective**: Verify commands are discoverable and invokable via Claude Code CLI

#### Test Steps:
1. List available commands: Check if cc- commands appear in Claude Code command list
2. Help text: Verify `/cc-ccc --help` shows command description
3. Basic invocation: Test `/cc-ccc` executes without syntax errors
4. Invalid usage: Test error handling for malformed command calls

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All 4 commands (cc-ccc, cc-nnn, cc-rrr, cc-gogogo) discoverable
- [ ] Help text displays correctly for each command
- [ ] Commands execute without syntax/parsing errors
- [ ] Clear error messages for invalid usage

### T003.2: Command Conflict Prevention
**Objective**: Verify cc- prefix prevents conflicts with existing commands

#### Test Steps:
1. List existing commands: Document any existing cc- prefixed commands
2. Conflict detection: Verify no command name collisions
3. Original commands: Verify original short codes still work in CLAUDE.md context
4. Fallback behavior: Test graceful handling if conflicts exist

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] No naming conflicts with existing Claude Code commands
- [ ] Clear distinction between cc- commands and originals
- [ ] Original short codes preserved for CLAUDE.md usage

### T003.3: Individual Command Functionality
**Objective**: Test each command's core functionality independently

#### cc-ccc (Context & Compact)
**Prerequisites**: Uncommitted git changes, active session
1. Execute `/cc-ccc` with git changes present
2. Verify GitHub context issue creation
3. Verify conversation compacting occurs
4. Check smart suggestions for next steps

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Context issue created in GitHub with relevant information
- [ ] Conversation successfully compacted
- [ ] Smart suggestions provided based on current state

#### cc-nnn (Smart Planning)
**Prerequisites**: Recent context issue or explicit issue reference
1. Execute `/cc-nnn` after context creation
2. Execute `/cc-nnn #123` with specific issue reference
3. Verify analysis-only behavior (no file modifications)
4. Check implementation plan issue creation

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Implementation plan issue created with detailed analysis
- [ ] No files modified during execution (analysis only)
- [ ] Plan contains actionable implementation steps
- [ ] Context detection works correctly

#### cc-rrr (Retrospective)
**Prerequisites**: Session with meaningful git history and changes
1. Execute `/cc-rrr` after development session
2. Verify retrospective structure and completeness
3. Check file export to retrospectives/ directory
4. Validate timeline and learnings capture

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Retrospective file created with required sections
- [ ] Git history and timeline accurately captured
- [ ] AI Diary and Honest Feedback sections present
- [ ] File exported to correct directory structure

#### cc-gogogo (Execute Implementation)
**Prerequisites**: Recent implementation plan issue from cc-nnn
1. Execute `/cc-gogogo` after creating plan with cc-nnn
2. Verify plan detection and parsing
3. Check step-by-step execution with confirmations
4. Validate file modifications and commits

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Recent plan issue correctly identified and loaded
- [ ] Implementation steps executed in logical order
- [ ] File modifications occur as specified in plan
- [ ] Proper error handling if plan not found

### T003.4: Workflow Sequence Testing
**Objective**: Test complete workflow sequences (command chaining)

#### Complete Development Workflow
**Scenario**: New feature development from start to finish
1. **Context**: `/cc-ccc` - Create context with git changes
2. **Planning**: `/cc-nnn` - Analyze and create implementation plan
3. **Implementation**: `/cc-gogogo` - Execute the plan step-by-step
4. **Documentation**: `/cc-rrr` - Create session retrospective

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Each command builds upon previous command's output
- [ ] Context flows correctly between commands
- [ ] Smart suggestions guide user through logical sequence
- [ ] Complete development lifecycle captured and documented

#### Investigation Workflow
**Scenario**: Bug investigation and analysis
1. **Context**: `/cc-ccc` - Capture current investigation state
2. **Analysis**: `/cc-nnn` - Research and analyze the issue
3. **Documentation**: `/cc-rrr` - Document findings and next steps

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Investigation context properly captured
- [ ] Analysis focuses on understanding vs. implementation
- [ ] Findings documented for future reference

### T003.5: Smart Suggestions Validation
**Objective**: Verify context-aware workflow suggestions work correctly

#### Context-Aware Behavior
1. **Dirty Git State**: Verify cc-ccc suggested when uncommitted changes present
2. **Clean State + Context**: Verify cc-nnn suggested when context issue exists
3. **Plan Ready**: Verify cc-gogogo suggested when implementation plan available
4. **Session End**: Verify cc-rrr suggested after significant activity

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Suggestions match current project state accurately
- [ ] Reasoning provided for each suggestion
- [ ] Suggestions prevent invalid workflow states
- [ ] Fallback suggestions when prerequisites missing

### T003.6: Error Handling & Edge Cases
**Objective**: Validate graceful error handling and edge case behavior

#### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Missing Dependencies**: Test when gh CLI not authenticated
2. **No Git Repository**: Test commands in non-git directory
3. **Network Issues**: Test offline behavior and fallbacks
4. **Permission Errors**: Test with read-only directories

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Clear error messages with actionable next steps
- [ ] Graceful degradation when dependencies unavailable
- [ ] No crashes or undefined behavior
- [ ] Appropriate fallback suggestions provided

### T003.7: Integration & Compatibility
**Objective**: Verify commands integrate properly with Claude Code ecosystem

#### Claude Code Integration
1. **Command Registration**: Verify commands appear in Claude Code command registry
2. **Context Sharing**: Test sharing context between cc- commands and built-in commands
3. **Tool Integration**: Verify integration with Claude Code's tool ecosystem
4. **Performance**: Test command execution speed and responsiveness

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Seamless integration with existing Claude Code workflow
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Context sharing works across command boundaries
- [ ] Tool interactions function correctly
