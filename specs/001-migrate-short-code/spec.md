# Feature Specification: Migrate Short Codes to Claude Code Slash Commands

**Feature Branch**: `001-migrate-short-code`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "migrate short code in claude.md to claude code slash command"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using Claude Code, I want to use familiar slash commands instead of typing short codes (like `ccc`, `nnn`, `rrr`) so that my workflow feels more integrated with the Claude Code environment and I can discover available commands through the standard slash command interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has been using short codes like `ccc` for context creation, **When** they type `/context`, **Then** the same context creation workflow executes
2. **Given** a user types `/` in Claude Code, **When** auto-complete appears, **Then** they see the migrated commands (`/context`, `/plan`, `/retrospective`) with descriptions
3. **Given** a user runs `/plan` with an issue number, **When** the command executes, **Then** it performs the same analysis and planning workflow as the `nnn` short code
4. **Given** a user runs `/retrospective`, **When** the command completes, **Then** it generates the same detailed session retrospective as the `rrr` short code

### Edge Cases
- When a user provides invalid arguments, system returns structured error with code, message, and remedy
- When required GitHub CLI is not available, system returns error code with installation instructions
- When command is run without proper git repository context, system returns error with repository setup guidance
- When conflicts exist with existing slash commands, new commands take precedence with clear naming

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: Should the original short codes (`ccc`, `nnn`, `rrr`) continue to work after migration? ‚Üí A: Keep both working (short codes + slash commands)
- Q: What naming strategy should the slash commands use? ‚Üí A: Descriptive names (`/context`, `/plan`, `/retrospective`)
- Q: Should the new slash commands support additional options beyond current functionality? ‚Üí A: Add common flags (`--verbose`, `--dry-run`)
- Q: How should error conditions be communicated when commands fail? ‚Üí A: Structured error (code, message, remedy)
- Q: What should be the command discovery mechanism for users? ‚Üí A: Auto-complete only when typing `/`

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide slash command equivalents for existing short codes (`ccc`, `nnn`, `rrr`)
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve all functionality from original short codes in the new slash commands
- **FR-003**: Slash commands MUST be discoverable through auto-complete when user types `/`
- **FR-004**: Each slash command MUST include a clear description of its purpose
- **FR-005**: System MUST support command arguments where applicable (e.g., issue numbers for planning)
- **FR-006**: Commands MUST maintain backward compatibility by keeping both short codes and slash commands functional
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide structured errors with error code, descriptive message, and suggested remedy when commands fail
- **FR-008**: Both short codes and slash commands MUST remain functional to support existing user workflows
- **FR-009**: Slash commands MUST use descriptive names: `/context` for `ccc`, `/plan` for `nnn`, `/retrospective` for `rrr`
- **FR-010**: Commands MUST support common flags: `--verbose` for detailed output, `--dry-run` for preview without execution
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide help documentation for each flag describing its behavior

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Slash Command**: A user-invokable command starting with `/` that executes a defined workflow
- **Command Registry**: Collection of available slash commands with their descriptions and argument specifications
- **Command Arguments**: Optional or required parameters passed to slash commands
- **Command Output**: Structured results from command execution (issues created, retrospectives generated, etc.)
