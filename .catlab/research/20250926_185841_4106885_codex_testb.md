## Research Report: TestB

### Executive Summary
TestB (the Interoperability Test Bed) is the European Commission DIGIT's reusable conformance testing platform, providing scenario-based simulations, validation services, and content verification for distributed systems and communities adopting shared digital services.citeturn5view0
Throughout 2025 the Test Bed team has maintained a rapid 1.27.x release cadence culminating in the 1.27.4 patch on August 27, 2025, reinforcing operational stability ahead of wider smart community roll-outs.citeturn14search6

### Key Findings
- Release 1.27.4 (August 27, 2025) resolved documentation import issues in test suite deployments, following earlier August patches (1.27.2–1.27.3) that addressed community configuration and UI ordering defects, signalling tight feedback loops with production users.citeturn14search6turn14search4turn14search5
- Release 1.27.0 (June 24, 2025) expanded test-step reporting control across XML, SOAP, and HTTP handlers, enabling finer-grained audits and troubleshooting in automated conformance pipelines.citeturn14search1
- DIGIT is positioning the Test Bed to certify Local Digital Twins Toolbox solutions for European Smart Communities by mid-2025, with live demonstrations planned for the November 5–7, 2025 Smart City Expo, underscoring TestB’s role beyond eDelivery and eInvoicing domains.citeturn14search8
- Official operations guidance emphasises streamlined upgrades via Docker Compose or Helm with 1.27.4-tagged images, guaranteeing backward-compatible rollouts that can be applied in minutes.citeturn12view0

### Technical Specifications
- Core components comprise the `gitb-srv` Spring Boot test engine and `gitb-ui` Scala/Play frontend with Angular user interface, distributed as Docker images maintained by DIGIT.citeturn11view0
- Builds from source require JDK 21+, Maven 3.9+, SBT 1.10+, Scala 2.13+, and Node 22+ toolchains to compile and package the engine and UI.citeturn11view0
- Deployments depend on MySQL 8+ for persistence and Redis 7+ for session caching, with container images provided for both services.citeturn11view0
- Recommended upgrade steps update Docker/Helm image tags to 1.27.4 for gitb-srv, gitb-ui, gitb-mysql, and gitb-redis before issuing `docker compose pull` and `docker compose up -d`, ensuring consistent rollouts across environments.citeturn12view0

### Conclusion
With stability patches and richer reporting controls landing in the 1.27.x line, organisations should plan prompt upgrades to 1.27.4, validate automation scripts against the new reporting options, and monitor DIGIT communications on the Local Digital Twins certification launch to align their conformance roadmaps.citeturn14search6turn14search1turn14search8
