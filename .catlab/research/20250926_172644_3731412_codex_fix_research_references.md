# Reference Fix Summary — September 26, 2025

## Updated research files
- `.catlab/research/20250926_162950_3491892_codex_nextjs_14_research.md`: replaced all `cite` placeholders with descriptive markdown links to the Next.js 14 release blogs, upgrade docs, and repository; rebuilt the references section with clean `url` entries.
- `.catlab/research/20250926_165208_3584748_codex_docker_container_optimization_best_practices.md`: converted citation tokens to explicit links covering Docker cache docs, security advisories, Hardened Images announcement, and related research publications; left references section intact with consistent formatting.
- `.catlab/research/20250926_165208_3608344_codex_docker_container_optimization_best_practices.md`: mapped multi-source placeholders to combinations of Docker Build Cloud resources, security notices, and cache guides, ensuring every claim cites a clickable URL.
- `.catlab/research/20250926_171443_3673483_codex_gist_reference_2.md`: swapped prompt-injection `turn` markers for direct links to the source gist, OpenAI mitigation guide, and PortSwigger research.
- `.catlab/research/20250926_171501_3679525_codex_spec_kit_reference_4.md`: replaced all search citation tokens with links to the Spec Kit quickstart, documentation, GitHub repository, Microsoft announcement, and DeepWiki references; deduplicated repetitive links in the dependency section.

## Validation steps
- Searched the `.catlab/research` directory to confirm no leftover `cite` placeholders remain.
- Spot-checked modified files to verify each reference now uses `https://...` syntax and retains the original narrative context.
