## Research Report: GitHub Spec-Kit Analysis

### Executive Summary
Spec Kit packages GitHub's specification-driven development methodology into a Python-based CLI and template system that lets teams move from natural-language specs to executable implementation assets while keeping AI agents aligned with organizational standards ([Spec Kit Quickstart Guide](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/quickstart.html), [Spec Kit CLI Reference](https://deepwiki.com/github/spec-kit/4-cli-tool-reference))

### Key Findings
- Project purpose and main functionality: Spec Kit centers on the Specify CLI, which scaffolds projects with constitutions, specs, plans, and task templates so AI agents can generate production-ready code from structured requirements ([Spec Kit Quickstart Guide](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/quickstart.html), [Spec Kit Documentation Overview](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/index.html))
- Architecture and design patterns: The CLI is implemented with Typer and Rich, downloads agent-specific template bundles, and orchestrates plan parsing plus agent context updates to keep multiple assistants in sync with project state ([Spec Kit CLI Reference](https://deepwiki.com/github/spec-kit/4-cli-tool-reference), [Spec Kit Project Configuration Guide](https://deepwiki.com/github/spec-kit/11-project-configuration))
- Integration capabilities and use cases: Initialization flows produce tailored command sets for Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Qwen, opencode, Windsurf, Codex, Kilo Code, Auggie, and Roo, enabling cross-agent workflows on shared artifacts ([Spec Kit Documentation Overview](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/index.html), [GitHub Spec Kit Repository](https://github.com/github/spec-kit))
- Relevance to development workflows: Spec-driven phases (specify → clarify → plan → analyze → tasks → implement) create traceable links between intent, technical decisions, and AI-executed tasks, reducing drift in multi-agent development teams ([Spec Kit Documentation Overview](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/index.html), [Spec-Driven Development Announcement](https://developer.microsoft.com/blog/spec-driven-development-spec-kit))

### Technical Specifications
- **Programming languages & frameworks**: Specify CLI targets Python 3.11+, uses Typer for command composition, Rich for terminal UX, httpx with truststore for secure downloads, and DocFX for documentation builds ([Spec Kit Documentation Overview](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/index.html), [Spec Kit Project Configuration Guide](https://deepwiki.com/github/spec-kit/11-project-configuration), [GitHub Spec Kit Repository](https://github.com/github/spec-kit))
- **Key dependencies & requirements**: Core dependencies include typer, rich, httpx[socks], platformdirs, readchar, and truststore (>=0.10.4); runtime prerequisites call for uv, Git, and an AI coding assistant compatible with the generated templates ([Spec Kit Project Configuration Guide](https://deepwiki.com/github/spec-kit/11-project-configuration), [Spec Kit Documentation Overview](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/index.html))
- **API specifications & interfaces**: The Typer-based CLI exposes `specify init` (with `--ai`, `--script`, `--here`, `--force`, `--ignore-agent-tools`, `--github-token` flags) plus `specify check`, while downstream slash commands (`/constitution`, `/specify`, `/clarify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/analyze`, `/implement`) drive agent-side workflows ([Spec Kit Documentation Overview](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/index.html), [Spec Kit CLI Reference](https://deepwiki.com/github/spec-kit/4-cli-tool-reference))
- **Installation & usage instructions**: Teams install or invoke the CLI via `uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git` or `uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>`, then run agent slash commands to iterate through spec-driven phases ([Spec Kit Documentation Overview](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/index.html), [GitHub Spec Kit Repository](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), [Spec-Driven Development Announcement](https://developer.microsoft.com/blog/spec-driven-development-spec-kit))

### Conclusion
Adopting Spec Kit inside catlab-kit would let the team codify product intent as living specifications, provision consistent agent command sets, and use the CLI’s plan-to-task automation to keep feature delivery synchronized across whichever AI assistants are plugged into the workflow, improving traceability and reducing manual scaffolding effort for future experiments.
