## Research Report: TestB

### Executive Summary
TestB, the European Commission DIGIT’s Interoperability Test Bed, offers scenario-based conformance testing via hosted and self-managed deployments for cross-border services (Published December 22, 2023) (https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/news/interoperability-test-bed).
Release 1.27.4 (Published August 27, 2025) continues the 2025 cadence by tightening documentation import workflows ahead of broader smart community roll-outs (https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/release/1274).

### Key Findings
- Release 1.27.4, published August 27, 2025, fixes test case documentation import issues and ships both as a DIGIT-hosted update and standalone artefacts for on-premise adopters (https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/release/1274).
- Earlier August 14, 2025 patches 1.27.2 and 1.27.3 resolved community configuration, secret parameter handling, and UI ordering defects, evidencing rapid feedback loops before the 1.27.4 rollout (https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/release/1272, https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/release/1273).
- Release 1.27.0, published June 24, 2025, expanded test-step reporting controls across XML, SOAP, and HTTP handlers while refreshing UI validation cues and health dashboards (https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/news/itb-v1270-released).
- DIGIT plans to use the Test Bed to certify Local Digital Twins Toolbox solutions by mid-2025, with live demonstrations scheduled during the November 5–7, 2025 Smart City Expo in Barcelona, signalling TestB’s growing role in smart community initiatives (https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/news/itb-support-smart-communities).
- Official update guidance instructs operators to retag Docker Compose or Helm deployments to the 1.27.4 images before executing `docker compose pull` and `docker compose up -d`, enabling quick, consistent upgrades (https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/docs/guides/latest/updatingTheTestBed/).

### Technical Specifications
- Core components pair the `gitb-srv` Spring Boot test engine with the `gitb-ui` Scala/Play service and Angular frontend, distributed as maintained Docker images (https://github.com/ISAITB/gitb/blob/master/README.md).
- Build prerequisites call for JDK 21+, Maven 3.9+, SBT 1.10+, Scala 2.13+, and Node.js 22+ to compile and package customised deployments (https://github.com/ISAITB/gitb/blob/master/README.md).
- Operational dependencies include MySQL 8+ for persistence and Redis 7+ for session caching, available as `isaitb/gitb-mysql` and `isaitb/gitb-redis` images (https://github.com/ISAITB/gitb/blob/master/README.md).
- Deployment cadence aligns gitb-srv, gitb-ui, gitb-mysql, and gitb-redis tags to 1.27.4, matching the August 27, 2025 release and the prescribed update sequence (https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/release/1274, https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/docs/guides/latest/updatingTheTestBed/).
- DIGIT offers a free multi-tenant hosted service (operational Monday–Friday 05:00–20:00 CET) alongside self-managed deployments, allowing sandbox replication for local testing (https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/detailed-information).

### Conclusion
Teams should upgrade to 1.27.4, revalidate automation against the enhanced reporting controls introduced in 1.27.0, and coordinate roadmaps with the upcoming Smart Communities certification milestones to maximise TestB’s cross-domain value (https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/release/1274, https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/news/itb-v1270-released, https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/news/itb-support-smart-communities).
