# PocketBase Research Report — September 26, 2025

## Executive Summary
- PocketBase v0.30.0 shipped on September 7, 2025, adding stricter S3 request path escaping, a Lark OAuth2 provider, new JSVM `os.Root` bindings, and raising the minimum Go toolchain to 1.24.0 alongside UI refinements. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)
- The official documentation continues to stress PocketBase’s pre-1.0 status while distributing fresh v0.30.0 binaries for all major platforms, reinforcing the need to monitor changelog-driven updates. (https://pocketbase.io/docs/)
- Rapid v0.29.x cadence delivered Apple OAuth2 data improvements, extended JSVM bindings, additional OAuth providers, and operational fixes between July and August 2025, signaling ongoing platform hardening. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)
- The 0.22.x long-term stream remains maintained via backports such as v0.22.35, sustaining production users who defer the v0.23+ breaking changes. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)
- Community distribution channels (AUR and PyPI `pocketbase-bin`) simultaneously published v0.30.0 artifacts on September 7, 2025, enabling streamlined installation across Linux distros, Python environments, and CI pipelines.

## Feature Highlights
### v0.30.0 Focus Areas
- **Object storage hardening:** Escaping S3 request paths now mirrors signature rules to prevent subtle mismatches when objects contain special characters. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)
- **Auth integrations:** New Lark OAuth2 provider expands enterprise single sign-on coverage; test token expiration handling was relaxed to stabilize reproducible builds. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)
- **Server scripting ergonomics:** Fresh JSVM `os.Root` bindings let hooks interact with the filesystem root more safely, while `osutils.IsProbablyGoRun()` improves diagnostics in dev workflows. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)
- **Operational prerequisites:** Projects embedding the Go package must adopt Go 1.24.0+, and admins gain quality-of-life UI updates (seconds in date picker, clearer index tooling). (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)

### v0.29.x Stream Themes
- **OAuth coverage:** Added Box.com support (v0.29.1) and improved Apple OAuth2 payload propagation (v0.29.3), reducing manual user provisioning friction. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)
- **Runtime stability:** Recompiled against SQLite 3.50.3, tightened rate limiter telemetry, and patched WASM build quirks to aid alternative deployment targets. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)
- **Extensibility tooling:** Registered missing JSVM migration bindings and refreshed generated types to keep custom migrations aligned with core APIs. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)

### Sustained v0.22.x Support
- Backports such as v0.22.35 continue to propagate runtime improvements without adopting the broad API changes introduced in v0.23+, offering a conservative path for production workloads. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)

## Platform Overview
PocketBase ships as a single-file backend combining SQLite persistence, real-time subscriptions, built-in auth management, admin UI, and REST-ish APIs. It can operate as a standalone binary or be embedded as a Go framework, with autogenerated `pb_data` and `pb_migrations` directories to manage datasets and schema evolution. (https://pocketbase.io/docs/)

## Upgrade & Migration Guidance
- **Breaking changes at v0.23:** Official Go and JSVM upgrade guides detail the removal of the legacy `Dao` layer, router syntax changes, new cron scheduler, and migration API adjustments. Teams are urged to stage upgrades, refactor hooks/migrations, and pin SDK versions if remaining on 0.22.x. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md, https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/)
- **Operational playbook:** Recommended steps include full `pb_data` backups, temporarily disabling migrations during code refactors, and regenerating collection snapshots post-upgrade (`migrate collections`, `history-sync`). (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md, https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/)
- **Managed hosting considerations:** PocketHost advises testing upgrades on cloned instances, locking semver ranges (e.g., `~0.30.0`), and avoiding unsupported downgrades to prevent schema drift in hosted environments. (https://pockethost.io/docs)

## Distribution & Tooling Landscape
- **Official binaries:** Download links for Linux, macOS, and Windows (x64/ARM64) remain centralized in the docs, simplifying direct installs or container bundling. (https://pocketbase.io/docs/)
- **Operating system packages:** The Arch User Repository (`pocketbase-bin`) updated to v0.30.0 on September 7, 2025, providing a managed system package for rolling-release users. (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pocketbase-bin)
- **Python ecosystem:** The `pocketbase-bin` PyPI distribution published synchronized wheels/tarballs for v0.30.0 across desktop, server, and Android targets, enabling scripted installs in CI/CD and multi-arch environments. (https://pypi.org/project/pocketbase-bin/)
- **CLI maintenance:** Users can invoke `./pocketbase update` (introduced earlier; reiterated in release notes) to fetch newer binaries directly, streamlining version hygiene. (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.30.0)

## Action Items for Teams
1. Evaluate Go 1.24 readiness and adjust CI toolchains before adopting v0.30.0.
2. Audit OAuth provider configurations to leverage new Lark and Box integrations where applicable.
3. Plan migrations off custom `Dao` code by following the v0.23 guides; prioritize regression testing in staged environments.
4. Align deployment automation with updated package sources (AUR, PyPI) to keep build artifacts current.
5. For production tenants on v0.22.x, schedule maintenance windows to ingest backports and revisit upgrade timelines before Q1 2026.
