## Research Report: Next.js 14 Features & Improvements

### Executive Summary
Next.js 14, released on October 26, 2023, delivered stable Server Actions, a preview of Partial Prerendering, and sizable Turbopack speed-ups, with the follow-on 14.1 (January 18, 2024) and 14.2 (April 11, 2024) updates adding self-hosting guidance, image enhancements, caching controls, and a Turbopack release candidate to sustain momentum into 2025.citeturn0search0turn0search1turn1search1

### Key Findings
- Major new features: Server Actions graduated to stable in the App Router, Partial Prerendering entered preview, metadata `viewport`/`generateViewport` exports modernize head management, and `@next/third-parties` components expand integration patterns.citeturn5view0turn3view0
- Performance improvements: Turbopack delivers up to 53% faster local startups and 94% faster hot updates, 14.1 logged up to 76.7% faster startups and 96.3% quicker refreshes on large apps, and 14.2’s release-candidate hits 99.8% integration-test coverage while cutting build memory usage and introducing a debug memory flag.citeturn5view0turn0search1turn1search1
- Breaking changes: Minimum runtime jumps to Node.js 18.17, `next export` is replaced by `output: 'export'`, `ImageResponse` moves to `next/og`, and legacy `@next/font` support is removed.citeturn5view0turn2search1
- Migration considerations: Run provided codemods for `next/og` and fonts, audit CSS import order with the new chunking strategy, adopt caching controls like `staleTimes` thoughtfully, and validate infrastructure for the Node.js 18.17+ requirement before rolling out Server Actions broadly.citeturn5view0turn1search1turn2search1

### Technical Specifications
- Node.js requirements: Node.js 18.17 or later across macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux environments.citeturn2search0
- React version compatibility: App Router runs atop the latest React canary channel with Server Actions stable, and official upgrade guides target React 18 when moving to Next.js 14.citeturn5view0turn2search1
- New APIs and functions: Metadata `viewport`/`generateViewport`, caching helpers like `unstable_noStore`, configurable `staleTimes`, the `overrideSrc` prop for `next/image`, `revalidateReason` for ISR insights, and the `--experimental-debug-memory-usage` build flag extend platform control.citeturn5view0turn3view0turn1search1

### Conclusion
Adopting Next.js 14 positions teams to leverage stable Server Actions, progressive rendering via Partial Prerendering, and continuously improving Turbopack tooling, making an upgrade worthwhile once Node.js 18.17+ baselines, codemods, and application-level regression tests are in place.citeturn5view0turn1search1
