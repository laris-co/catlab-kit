## Research Report: Test clean citation format

### Executive Summary
The 7th edition of the *Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association* remains the foundational reference for author–date citation practice, pairing inclusive language guidance with updated templates for contemporary sources (https://guides.nyu.edu/citations/apa/). Chicago’s 18th edition, published on 19 September 2024, extends its dual notes-and-bibliography and author–date systems with digital-first guidance, while its maintainers continue to ship errata updates through 2025 (https://guides.nyu.edu/citations/chicago, https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/help-tools/Corrections-to-the-18th-Edition.html). IEEE’s July 2024 refresh of its editorial style manual reinforces numbered in-text citations aligned with engineering publication workflows, and Crossref’s DOI display rules remain the interoperability backbone for clean, persistent links (https://libguides.wvu.edu/IEEE, https://www.crossref.org/display-guidelines/).

### Key Findings
- Chicago 18th edition clarifies credit for up to six authors in bibliographies, modernizes title capitalization (including capitalizing prepositions of five or more letters), and introduces policies for citing AI-generated media—changes aimed at reducing ambiguity in long-form scholarly references (https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/help-tools/what-s-new.html).
- University of Chicago Press is actively maintaining the 18th edition, issuing corrections as recently as 13 August 2025 to keep citation examples authoritative; teams using CMOS should monitor these bulletins when validating style automation (https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/help-tools/Corrections-to-the-18th-Edition.html).
- APA’s 7th edition guidance centers on bias-free language, streamlined student and professional templates, and expanded reference exemplars for social media, audiovisual, and legal sources—critical for teams enforcing consistent author–date citations across digital research outputs (https://guides.nyu.edu/citations/apa/).
- IEEE’s editorial style suite (updated July 2024) reiterates square-bracketed numeric citations, links to dedicated reference and mathematics guides, and positions The Chicago Manual of Style as its fallback for grammar—highlighting cross-style dependencies that tooling must account for (https://libguides.wvu.edu/IEEE, https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/your-role-in-article-production/ieee-editorial-style-manual/).
- Crossref’s DOI display guidelines (effective March 2017, last updated 21 April 2021) mandate presenting DOIs as full HTTPS URLs without the dx prefix, ensuring copyable, persistent identifiers across metadata feeds and reference lists (https://www.crossref.org/display-guidelines/).

### Technical Specifications
- APA Style: Publication Manual, 7th edition (2020 printing); supports up to 20 authors before ellipsis, expanded digital media templates, and inclusive language checklists; widely adopted across psychology, education, business, and health disciplines (https://guides.nyu.edu/citations/apa/).
- Chicago Manual of Style: 18th edition (print release 2024-09-19); bibliographies list up to six authors before “et al.”, remove place-of-publication requirements, and drop page ranges for book chapters; online service provides living errata (https://guides.nyu.edu/citations/chicago, https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/help-tools/what-s-new.html).
- IEEE Editorial Style Manual: Transactions & Journals guidance last updated July 2024; integrates reference and mathematics supplements, prescribes numeric in-text citations, and defers unresolved grammar issues to CMOS (https://libguides.wvu.edu/IEEE, https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/your-role-in-article-production/ieee-editorial-style-manual/).
- Crossref Infrastructure: DOI display policy (March 2017; maintainer update 2021-04-21) requires HTTPS-formatted links and discourages proprietary URLs in reference exports, underpinning stable citation linking across publishers (https://www.crossref.org/display-guidelines/).

### Conclusion
Maintain tooling baselines against the 2020 APA manual, the 2024 Chicago release plus ongoing errata, IEEE’s July 2024 editor resources, and Crossref’s DOI display rules to guarantee citations remain accurate, accessible, and machine-actionable across multidisciplinary publishing pipelines (https://guides.nyu.edu/citations/apa/, https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/help-tools/what-s-new.html, https://libguides.wvu.edu/IEEE, https://www.crossref.org/display-guidelines/).
