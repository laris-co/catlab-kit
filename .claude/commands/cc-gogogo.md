# cc-gogogo (Execute Implementation)

Run the implementation phase by consuming the latest planning issue, validating the workflow, executing the steps in order, and reporting progress back to the plan and repository.

## Usage
```
/cc-gogogo [--plan <issue-number>] [--branch <name>] [--dry-run]
```

## What this command does

- Validates that a recent `/cc-nnn` plan issue exists and is executable before touching the workspace.
- Parses the plan's task list into sequential steps, groups optional parallel items, and builds a progress tracker.
- Prepares the git workspace (status check, branch verification/creation, dependency hooks) with user confirmations for risky actions.
- Executes each plan step with built-in prompts for file edits, test runs, and verification, updating plan checkboxes and local progress after every step.
- Handles commits, prepares PR updates, and surfaces blockers while keeping the user in control of writing, staging, or pushing changes.
- Emits a final summary with completed work, remaining tasks, suggested `/cc-rrr`, and next-step recommendations.

## Key Features

- âœ… Plan-first safety: refuses to run without a valid `/cc-nnn` issue; dry-run preview to confirm readiness.
- ðŸ”§ Guided execution: structured loop with per-step instructions, git safeguards, and optional automation helpers.
- ðŸ“Š Progress telemetry: real-time tracker, checkbox updates, and clear status outputs for each phase.

## Architecture

- Reads plan metadata through `gh issue view` (or cached JSON) to pull phases, acceptance criteria, and linked issues.
- Uses lightweight parsing to build a normalized step array with attributes (`id`, `description`, `type`, `requires_tests`, `files`).
- Maintains runtime state in memory (current step index, completion flags, pending follow-ups); persists status notes to `.catlab/workers/` for traceability.
- Wraps git/gh operations in guard clauses (status clean required unless `--force`, interactive confirmation prior to destructive commands).
- Integrates with existing scripts (e.g., `codex-exec.sh`) when steps need shell automation or background work.
