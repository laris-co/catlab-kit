description: Run the newest cc-nnn implementation plan with full execution permissions.
---

# cc-gogogo

Execute the most recent implementation plan end-to-end, managing file work, tests, commits, and progress updates.

## Usage
```
cc-gogogo
```

## What this command does

- Validates that a recent implementation plan issue exists before any execution.
- Retrieves and parses the plan steps generated by `cc-nnn`.
- Executes each step in dependency order, enabling file edits, tooling runs, and shell commands as needed.
- Tracks per-step progress, committing logical change sets with plan references.
- Updates the plan issue with completed steps and summarizes final results.

## Key Features

- Plan-first safety: refuses to run without a valid, well-formed implementation plan.
- Stepwise automation: adheres to plan ordering while honoring declared dependencies.
- Full execution permissions: file modifications, git operations, and system commands are all allowed.
- Progress transparency: records outcomes, surfaces blockers, and mirrors status back to the issue tracker.
- Smart follow-ups: recommends the next workflow command based on execution outcome.

## Architecture

### Plan detection
- Query the issue tracker for the newest implementation plan labeled or authored by `cc-nnn`.
- Confirm required structural markers (step numbering, descriptions, acceptance notes); otherwise emit "Cannot parse plan format - check plan structure".
- Abort with "No recent implementation plan - run /cc-nnn first" when nothing qualifies.

### Execution methodology
- Expand each plan item into actionable tasks, capturing expected files, commands, and verification steps.
- Execute sequentially, respecting declared dependencies and halting on the first failure.
- Surface failures with "Step X failed: [specific error] - suggest fixes" and retain logs for troubleshooting.

### Change management
- Group edits produced by each plan step into cohesive commits that reference the step number and plan issue.
- Manage branches as needed (create, switch, merge) while keeping git history clean and reviewable.
- After every successful step, mark the corresponding checkbox or status note in the plan issue to reflect progress.

## Execution permissions

- File modifications allowed (create, update, delete project files).
- Git operations allowed (branching, committing, rebasing, merging).
- System operations allowed (build, test, install, lint, formatter runs, tooling invocations).

## Smart suggestions

- No plan found → suggest running `/cc-nnn` to generate an implementation plan.
- Successful execution → suggest `/cc-rrr` to capture the retrospective.
- Execution failure → suggest reviewing errors or rerunning `/cc-nnn` for an updated plan.

## Error handling

- No recent implementation plan - run `/cc-nnn` first.
- Cannot parse plan format - check plan structure.
- Step X failed: [specific error] - suggest fixes.
- Cannot modify files - check permissions.

# cc-gogogo is executed by the Claude Code runtime handler
